Hello, this is my first english post!

A little story about why this blog was finally created because I'm a forgetful person. Sometimes I take notes, sometimes I don't. If I take notes, my notes are scattered everywhere so it's hard to find them. So I hope with this blog, my notes will be kept better, and will make me write more often what I find, and my daily experiences that are useful.

I hope that the posts on this blog in the future could also help you! I'm also open to your contributions through criticism, and suggestions which you can send to my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/agalliosamai) and also issues and pull requests to this blog [repository](https://github.com/agallio/agall.io).

Thank you, and have a nice day! 😁
